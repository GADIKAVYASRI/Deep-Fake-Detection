This repository presents a deepfake detection model built using TensorFlow/Keras and the EfficientNetB3 architecture, designed to identify synthetic media with high accuracy. 
This is developed in Google Colab, the model leverages transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt pre-trained ImageNet weights for deepfake detection, ensuring robust performance even with limited data.
It includes features like automatic dataset organization, dynamic class balancing, and data augmentation to handle real-world challenges such as imbalanced datasets and varying image quality. 
The model tracks key metrics like accuracy, AUC, precision, and recall, and supports TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment. 
With a focus on scalability and usability, this solution is ideal for researchers and developers aiming to combat the growing threat of deepfakes.
